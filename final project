# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using Linear
Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm. The objective is to
analyze historical stock data and build a regression model that can
estimate future closing prices based on selected features.

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Analyze historical stock market data\
-   Perform data preprocessing and cleaning\
-   Explore relationships between stock features\
-   Train a Linear Regression model\
-   Evaluate prediction performance\
-   Interpret model results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Python\
-   NumPy\
-   Pandas\
-   Matplotlib\
-   Seaborn\
-   Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical stock market data with features such
as: - Date -- Trading date\
- Open -- Opening price\
- High -- Highest price of the day\
- Low -- Lowest price of the day\
- Close -- Closing price\
- Volume -- Number of shares traded

The target variable for prediction is the Closing Price.

## 🔎 Project Workflow

1.  Data Collection\
2.  Data Preprocessing\
3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
4.  Model Training using Linear Regression\
5.  Model Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score

## 📈 Results

The Linear Regression model identifies linear relationships between
stock features and closing price. While stock prices are influenced by
many unpredictable factors, the model captures general price trends
effectively.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be applied to
financial data for stock price prediction. Future improvements may
include advanced models, technical indicators, and hyperparameter
tuning.
